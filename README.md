This project file is for practice, to understand arrays much better
4 different directories here that I practiced to understand arrays and loops better
I learned there are other ways to declare and initialize arrays
the understanding is coming. bit by bit
It was my first time using the #define, a preprocessor directive used to define macros in a C program.
I am trying to understand it better.
